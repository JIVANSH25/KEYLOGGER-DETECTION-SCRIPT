# 🕵️ Suspicious Process & Keylogger Detector (Python)

A simple Python tool that scans for potentially malicious processes like keyloggers by comparing running process names against a list of suspicious patterns.

## 🔍 Features

- Detects suspicious process names commonly associated with keyloggers (e.g., "keylogger", "hook", "spy")
- Lists flagged processes with name and PID
- Provides basic guidance for manual keyboard hook inspection
- Lightweight and cross-platform (works on Windows, Linux, macOS)

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Uses `psutil` to iterate over all running processes.
2. Checks if the process name contains common keylogger terms.
3. Optionally suggests further analysis tools for deep inspection.
